# COMP 370 - Introduction to Data Science: Homework 4 
---

### Overview
In this assignment, we focus on analyzing New York City 311 service request data. The primary goal is to develop a dashboard that allows city leaders to explore discrepancies in service across zip codes, using a subset of the NYC 311 data from 2020.

### Tasks and Objectives
1. **CLI Investigation Tool**:
   - Develop `borough_complaints.py`, a Python-based command-line tool that outputs the number of each complaint type per borough for a given date range.

2. **Jupyter and EC2 Setup**:
   - Set up Jupyter on an EC2 instance with password login support.

3. **CLI Tool and Jupyter Analysis**:
   - Use the CLI tool in Jupyter to create a bar chart showing the occurrences of the most common complaint type in early 2020 and compare it to June-July 2020.

4. **Bokeh Dashboard**:
   - Build a dashboard using Bokeh to evaluate the difference in response time to 311 service complaints by zip code, including line plots of average create-to-close time.

### Key Learnings
- Implementation of a CLI tool using Python and argparse.
- Data visualization in Jupyter notebooks.
- Developing interactive dashboards with Bokeh for real-time data analysis.

### Submission Files
- `borough_complaints.py`: Python script for the CLI investigation tool.
- `complaint_type_analysis.md`: Analysis of the most common complaint type using Jupyter.
- `Bokeh.tgz`: Source code for the Bokeh dashboard.
