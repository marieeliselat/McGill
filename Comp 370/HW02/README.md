# COMP 370 - Introduction to Data Science: Homework 2

---
This assignment is designed to familiarize students with Unix EC2 as both a data science machine and as a server. It involves setting up a webserver and a database server on an EC2 instance.

### Key Objectives
- Set up and configure an Apache webserver on a Unix EC2 instance.
- Install and configure a MariaDB database server.
- Ensure security and accessibility for both the webserver and the database server.

### Tasks and Deliverables
- **Task 1: Setting up a Webserver**
  - Objective: Set up an Apache webserver to serve a file at the root directory.
  - Key steps include configuring the server, ensuring security settings allow traffic through port 8008, and serving the file `comp370_hw2.txt`.

- **Task 2: Setting up a Database Server**
  - Objective: Install and configure a MariaDB database server accessible from the public internet.
  - Steps include installing MariaDB, configuring it to run on an external port, creating an empty database named `comp370_test`, and setting up a user with appropriate access permissions.

### Technologies Used
- Unix EC2 Instance
- Apache Webserver
- MariaDB Database Server

### Submission Instructions
- `webserver_setup.md`: Document detailing the steps and commands to set up the webserver.
- `database_setup.md`: Document outlining the steps and commands to set up the database server.

### Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience in server and database setup and configuration.
- Enhanced understanding of Unix command-line interface and server management.
- Developed skills in ensuring the security and accessibility of web and database servers.
