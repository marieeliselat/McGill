# COMP 202 - Foundations of Programming: Final Project

---
### Overview
The final project involves analyzing a data file containing recorded CO2 emissions per country over the past 267 years. It focuses on data cleaning, object-oriented programming, and data visualization using Matplotlib. The project is an exercise in understanding file handling, algorithmic thinking, and data representation.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Perform data cleaning on raw dataset files.
- Implement object-oriented programming concepts in Python.
- Utilize Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Understand and analyze environmental data, particularly CO2 emissions.

### Project Components
1. **Data Cleanup**: Writing functions to clean up raw CO2 data, ensuring proper formatting and consistency.
2. **Continents Module**: Adding continent information to the cleaned data based on country ISO codes.
3. **Countries Module**: Creating a `Country` class to represent each country's data, including CO2 emissions and population.
4. **Data Plotting**: Using Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the data, such as CO2 emissions per capita by continent and historical CO2 emissions.

### Modules and Key Functions
- `data_cleanup.py`: Functions for initial data cleaning.
- `add_continents.py`: Functions to augment data with continent information.
- `build_countries.py`: The Country class and related functionalities.
- `plot_data.py`: Functions for visualizing data with Matplotlib.
