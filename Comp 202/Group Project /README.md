# COMP 202 - Foundations of Programming: Group Project

---

### Overview
The group project for COMP 202 involves developing an automated player for the card game Three Thirteen. This project applies concepts of Python programming, focusing on function implementation, decision-making algorithms, and game strategy development.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Implement complex game strategies in Python.
- Develop functions for drawing and discarding cards with strategic decision-making.
- Utilize list and dictionary manipulations for handling game states.
- Collaborate effectively in a group to develop a cohesive codebase.

### Project Description
- **Automated Player for Three Thirteen**: 
   - Develop `ai_player.py`, which contains functions for the automated player's actions in the game.
   - Implement `draw` and `discard` functions with strategic logic based on the current game state.
   - Test and optimize the player's strategy to compete effectively in simulated games.

### Key Functions
- `draw(hand, top_discard, last_turn, picked_up_discard_cards, player_index, wildcard_rank, num_turns_this_round)`: Decides whether to draw from the stock or discard pile.
- `discard(hand, last_turn, picked_up_discard_cards, player_index, wildcard_rank, num_turns_this_round)`: Decides which card to discard from the hand.

### Submission Requirements
- `ai_player.py`: The main file containing the automated player's logic.

### Collaborative Effort
- This project is a collaborative effort of the group. Equal participation is expected from all members.
