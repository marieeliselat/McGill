# COMP 202 - Foundations of Programming: Assignment 3

---

### Overview
Assignment 3 is designed to apply and consolidate knowledge in Python programming, focusing on list and dictionary manipulations, string processing, file IO, and developing complex programs with multiple modules. The main task is to build a system that can identify synonyms based on semantic similarity.

### Key Learning Objectives
- Apply advanced list and dictionary manipulations.
- Deepen understanding of file IO in Python.
- Develop skills in string processing and text analysis.
- Implement and use semantic similarity measures.
- Create a multi-module Python program.

### Assignment Contents
**Identify Synonyms**: 
   - Implement a system to identify synonyms based on semantic similarity.
   - Develop functions for semantic descriptor vector creation, similarity measures (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance), and file processing.
   - Test the system on TOEFL-like synonym questions.

### Modules and Key Functions
- `vectors_utils.py`: Utility functions for vector operations.
- `similarity_measures.py`: Functions for computing semantic similarity between words.
- `file_processing.py`: Functions for reading files and extracting semantic descriptors.
- `synonyms_solver.py`: Main module for solving synonym questions.
